        “What’s going on with this championship?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Is something wrong with the system?
        First, it was a match between a former
        top-eight party and one of the current
        seeded parties. Now, it is a match between
        the former second-place party and a former
        top-eight party. Are we going to see half
        of the top-ranking parties get eliminated
        in the first round?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “This shouldn’t be happening. None of the
        previous Continental Championships have
        ever matched the seeded parties against
        each other so early into the main event.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At this time, whether it was the parties
        waiting for their turn outside the ring or
        the players spectating from the spectator
        stands, they all couldn’t help but suspect
        something had gone wrong with the Main God
        System. Otherwise, such match-ups
        shouldn’t have occurred so early into the
        main event.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In past Continental Championships, parties
        who placed in the top 10 of the
        preliminaries would never encounter each
        other in the round of 32. It was also why
        the top 10 parties in the preliminaries
        were regarded as seeded parties. Yet, even
        though they were only into the second
        match of the round of 32, four of the ten
        seeded parties had already been matched
        against each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em
          >Is this ancient being trying to mess
          with us?</em
        >&nbsp;Verdant Rainbow was at a loss for
        words as she looked up at the mighty
        silhouette in the sky.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Originally, Verdant Rainbow thought that
        after having defeated the Holy Guard
        Party, one of the former top-eight
        parties, her party should have a solid
        chance at entering the top eight. She
        wouldn’t even discount the possibility of
        entering the top four anymore.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, after seeing the Earthen Princess
        Party being selected for the second match,
        Verdant Rainbow couldn’t help but feel
        like her party was getting targeted by the
        Continental Championship’s organizer.
        After all, the winners of the first and
        second matches in the round of 32 would be
        scheduled to fight each other in the round
        of 16. If anyone were to tell her that her
        party wasn’t being singled out, she would
        be the first to cast doubt at them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Of course, the Eight Paths Party had even
        worse luck than her party. As a former
        top-eight party and one of the current
        seeded parties, the Eight Paths Party
        should have no trouble entering the top 16
        under normal circumstances. However, now
        that it was matched against the Earthen
        Princess Party, its journey in the
        Continental Championship was destined to
        stop at the top 32. Even if the Eight
        Paths Party cried foul right now, nobody
        would blame it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>…</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, every member of the Eight Paths
        Party wore gloomy expressions as they
        stepped into the ring. Evidently, they did
        not expect the system to be so ruthless as
        to pair them against an unbeatable
        opponent in the first round.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Eight Paths, admit defeat,” Rin, who
        stood six meters tall, said as she looked
        at the leader of the Eight Paths Party.
        “You stand no chance in this match.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Rin, I admit that you are strong, but
        this is a group battle. We won’t know the
        outcome until we fight,” Eight Paths of
        Sovereign Mark said, choosing to stand his
        ground despite knowing the overwhelming
        odds. “Do you remember the Star Maiden
        Party? Even though Elise was stronger than
        me, didn’t she still lose to my party?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Venom Tail and the other members of the
        Eight Paths Party nodded in agreement.
        Admittedly, Rin the Earthen Princess was a
        mighty expert. However, in the previous
        Continental Championship, the Earthen
        Princess Party and the Star Maiden Party
        shared a similarity in that they both
        relied heavily on their key members. Like
        how the Star Maiden Party relied on Elise,
        the Earthen Princess Party also relied
        heavily on Rin for its accomplishments. As
        for the other members of the two parties,
        they were much less fearsome in
        comparison.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Thus, victory was still possible so long
        as the Eight Paths Party could quickly
        regroup and eliminate Rin’s party members
        first.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Suit yourself,” Rin said, shaking her
        head. “You are merely putting up a futile
        struggle.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Subsequently, the second match of the main
        event began. To no one’s surprise, the
        Earthen Princess Party emerged victorious.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, what did surprise the spectators
        was the fact that the Earthen Princess
        never made a move throughout the match.
        Only two of her party members fought the
        entire time. In terms of overall strength,
        the two members of the Earthen Princess
        Party were much stronger than the Eight
        Paths Party’s six members, and the battle
        between the two sides ended shortly after
        it started.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, after witnessing the second
        match’s outcome, everyone understood that
        the Earthen Princess Party had already
        rectified the one weakness it had in the
        last Continental Championship.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>…</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the second match concluded, Shi Feng
        made his way to a private lounge in the
        Crucible of the Ancients.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Miss Elise, may I know what you have
        called me for this time?” Shi Feng asked
        as he looked at Elise, who had been
        resting in the lounge for some time now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I’ve previously said that your party has
        a chance of entering the top four, but
        that might not be possible if you come
        across the Divine Fist Party or the
        Earthen Princess Party.” While glancing
        through a report from her subordinate,
        Elise indifferently asked, “Now that
        you’ve seen the Earthen Princess Party’s
        strength, do you still wish to persist?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Naturally,” Shi Feng answered without
        hesitation. “The current Earthen Princess
        Party might be much stronger than before,
        but I believe in my party’s capabilities.
        Of course, if you are willing to let me
        borrow your Goddess Tablet for some time,
        I wouldn’t mind giving up the opportunity
        to fight the Earthen Princess Party, Miss
        Elise.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “What a bold claim. Are
        you&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>confident of
        defeating Rin?” Elise snorted
        disdainfully. “It didn’t seem like you had
        an easy time winning against the Holy
        Guard Party previously.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who had watched the first match
        would know that the Verdant Rainbow Party
        had barely won against the Holy Guard
        Party. Hence, there was virtually no hope
        for the Verdant Rainbow Party to win
        against the Earthen Princess Party, which
        was significantly stronger than the Holy
        Guard Party.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Why don’t you take a look at this, then?”
        Shi Feng did not bother to refute Elise’s
        statement. Instead, he took out a small
        stack of scrolls from his bag.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, as soon as Elise saw the
        scrolls, her expression instantly changed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Intermediate Divine Engraving Scrolls?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Elise was greatly shocked as she looked at
        the scrolls covered in divine patterns in
        Shi Feng’s hands.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Compared to Divine Artifacts, the rarity
        of Intermediate Divine Engraving Scrolls
        was even greater in the Greater God’s
        Domain. Even the various apex powers only
        had a few in their possession. Even now,
        there was only one known place where
        players could reliably acquire
        Intermediate Divine Engraving
        Scrolls—Luminous Sky City’s Abyss Chamber
        of Commerce!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Abyss Chamber of Commerce’s background
        was shrouded in mystery. It would release
        about a dozen Intermediate Divine
        Engraving Scrolls every once in a while.
        However, such a small number was nowhere
        near enough for the various powers to
        share. Thus, the scrolls would always be
        sold out as soon as they became available.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yet, now, Shi Feng had taken out over a
        dozen of these scrolls. This was simply
        unbelievable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Indeed. These are all Intermediate Divine
        Engraving Scrolls,” Shi Feng said,
        chuckling. “I still have some more inside
        my bag, enough to use on the Fragmented
        Legendary Equipment Sets of Zero Wing’s
        four members. I’m sure I don’t need to
        tell you how much improvement we can
        receive from these scrolls, right, Miss
        Elise?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shi Feng had prepared amply for the
        Continental Championship. Aside from
        equipping Gentle Snow and the others with
        the new God Chaser Set, he had also
        prepared enough Intermediate Divine
        Engraving Scrolls for four players.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Initially, he had held back from using the
        Intermediate Divine Engraving Scrolls,
        thinking that the new God Chaser Set
        should be enough to let them win the
        championship. However, the circumstances
        surrounding the latest Continental
        Championship had exceeded his
        expectations, so he had no choice but to
        use the scrolls now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “So this is the reason for your
        confidence.” Elise took a long look at Shi
        Feng. Then, after pondering for a while,
        she said, “Fine, I will loan the tablet to
        you. However, you will have only one day
        to study it. After one day, you must
        return it to me, regardless of whether you
        manage to learn anything!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “No problem.” Shi Feng nodded and smiled.
        Then, he took out a set of God’s Domain
        Contracts and said, “Let’s officialize the
        terms right away.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Goddess Tablet was extraordinary.
        Although Elise had only agreed to loan it
        to him for a short time, it was better
        than nothing. After all, even ordinary
        experts could benefit significantly from a
        surface analysis, let alone someone like
        him, who had in-depth experience studying
        a Goddess Tablet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After establishing the contract, Elise
        handed Shi Feng a palm-sized tablet and
        left the lounge to participate in her
        party’s first match in the main event.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, left alone in the lounge, Shi
        Feng did not waste time and immediately
        began studying the tablet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em>The Sixth Goddess Tablet?</em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shi Feng was greatly shocked by the
        information displayed on the tablet.
        Compared to Aqua Rose’s Goddess Tablet,
        Elise’s Goddess Tablet was in a completely
        different league.
